abstract = {The motion of DNA in crowded environments is a common theme in physics and biology. Examples include gel electro-phoresis and the self-interaction of DNA within cells and viral capsids. Here we study the interaction of multiple DNA molecules within a nanopore by tethering the DNA to a bead held in a laser optical trap to produce a "molecular tug-of-war". We measure this tether force as a function of the number of DNA molecules in the pore and show that the force per molecule decreases with the number of molecules. A simple scaling argument based on a mean field theory of the hydrodynamic interactions between multiple DNA strands explains our observations. At high salt concentrations, when the Debye length approaches the size of the counterions, the force per molecule becomes essentially independent of the number of molecules. We attribute this to a sharp decrease in electroosmotic flow which makes the hydrodynamic interactions ineffective.},

abstract = {Fluid jets are found in nature at all length scales from microscopic to cosmological. Here we report on an electroosmotically driven jet from a single glass nanopore about 75 nm in radius with a maximum flow rate ∼15 pL/s. A novel anemometry technique allows us to map out the vorticity and velocity fields that show excellent agreement with the classical Landau−Squire solution of the Navier−Stokes equations for a point jet. We observe a phenomenon that we call flow rectification: an asymmetry in the flow rate with respect to voltage reversal. Such a nanojet could potentially find applications in micromanipulation, nanopatterning, and as a diode in microfluidic circuits.},

abstract = {Recent experimental work has suggested that electroosmotic flows (EOF) through conical nanopores exhibit rectification in the opposite sense to the well-studied effect of ionic current rectification. A positive bias voltage generates large EOF and small current, while negative voltages generate small EOF and large current. Here we systematically investigate this effect using finite-element simulations. We find that inside the pore, the electric field and salt concentration are inversely correlated, which leads to the inverse relationship between the magnitudes of EOF and current. Rectification occurs when the pore is driven into states characterized by different salt concentrations depending on the sign of the voltage. The mechanism responsible for this behaviour is concentration polarization, which requires the pore to exhibit the properties of permselectivity and asymmetry.},

abstract = {Single-molecule force spectroscopy is a powerful technique for studying the detailed behaviour of biopolymers such as DNA and proteins: by applying pN-scale forces to individual molecules, properties such as conformations, folding pathways, and intermolecular interaction strengths can be determined. Traditionally these studies have been carried out under static tension. The dynamic response of polymers to a sudden change in force is experimentally more challenging as the polymer is often coupled to an external molecular handle, which suppresses important physics at short (∼ms) timescales. Here we use a nanopore to electrically control the application of force to the end of a double-stranded DNA molecule; the other end of the molecule is attached to a bead held in an optical trap. By shutting off the voltage, the fast relaxation dynamics of the free polymer end can be studied. We observe for the first time an enhanced viscous friction which arises from the rapid internal contraction of the DNA, which is fully explained by theory. These studies pave the way for new dynamic force spectroscopy experiments, such as investigations of tension propagation along biomolecules, which has applications for both polymer theory as well as biological systems such as the cytoskeleton where dynamic tension can affect cellular response.},

abstract = {We report observations of a striking reversal in the direction of electroosmotic flow (EOF) outside a conical glass nanopore as a function of salt concentration. At high ionic strengths ({\textgreater}100 mM), we observe EOF in the expected direction as predicted by classical electrokinetic theory, while at low salt concentrations ({\textless}1 mM) the direction of the flow is reversed. The critical crossover salt concentration depends on the pore diameter. Finite-element simulations indicate a competition between the EOF generated from the inner and outer walls of the pore, which drives flows in opposite directions. We have developed a simple analytical model which reveals that, as the salt concentration is reduced, the flow rates inside the pore are geometrically constrained, whereas there is no such limit for flows outside the pore. This model captures all of the essential physics of the system and explains the observed data, highlighting the key role the external environment plays in determining the overall electroosmotic behavior.},

abstract = {Macroscopic objects are usually manipulated by force and observed with light. On the nanoscale, however, this is often done oppositely: individual macromolecules are manipulated by light and monitored with force. This procedure, which is the basis of single-molecule force spectroscopy, has led to much of our quantitative understanding of how DNA works, and is now routinely applied to explore molecular structure and interactions, DNA-protein reactions and protein folding. Here we develop the technique further by introducing a dynamic force spectroscopy setup for a non-invasive inspection of the tension dynamics in a taut strand of DNA. The internal contraction after a sudden release of the molecule is shown to give rise to a drastically enhanced viscous friction, as revealed by the slow relaxation of an attached colloidal tracer. Our systematic theory explains the data quantitatively and provides a powerful tool for the rational design of new dynamic force spectroscopy assays.},

abstract = {Aims. Periodic variability in young stellar objects (YSOs) offers indirect evidence for an active dynamical mechanism. Starspots, accretion, stellar companions, and disk veiling can contribute to the photometric variability of YSOs. Methods. As part of an ongoing study of the $\rho$ Oph star forming region, we report the discovery of 92.6 day periodic variations for the Class I YSO YLW 16A, observed over a period of three years. A SED model was fit to available photometric data for the object. Results. We propose a triple-system with an inner binary with a period of 93 days eclipsed by a warped circum-binary disk. The nature of the secondary is unconstrained and could be stellar or sub-stellar. We confirm the discovery of a tertiary companion at a projected separation of ∼40 AU that could account for the circum-binary disk warp. This light curve and model is similar to the model we proposed for WL 4 in previous work. Understanding these systems may lead to insights about the nature of stellar evolution and planetary formation, and provide valuable benchmarks for future theoretical modeling and near-and mid-infrared synoptic surveys of YSOs.},

abstract = {We show experimentally that an inexpensive glass microcapillary can accumulate lambda-phage DNA at its tip and deliver the DNA into the capillary using a combination of electro-osmotic flow, pressure-driven flow, and electrophoresis. We develop an efficient simulation model based on the electrokinetic equations and the finite-element method to explain this phenomenon. As a proof of concept for the generality of this trapping mechanism we use our numerical model to explore the effect of the salt concentration, the capillary surface charge, the applied voltage, the pressure difference, and the mobility of the analyte molecules. Our results indicate that the simple microcapillary system has the potential to capture a wide range of analyte molecules based on their electrophoretic mobility that extends well beyond our experimental example of lambda-phage DNA. Our method for separation and preconcentration of analytes therefore has implications for the development of low-cost lab-on-a-chip devices.},

Transcriptional repression is a fundamental function that can be tuned at the level of DNA, protein, and cooperative protein–protein interactions, necessitating high-throughput experimental approaches for in-depth characterization. Here, we used a cell-free system in combination with a high-throughput microfluidic device to comprehensively study the different tuning mechanisms of a synthetic zinc-finger repressor library, whose affinity and cooperativity can be rationally engineered. The device is integrated into a comprehensive workflow that includes determination of transcription-factor binding-energy landscapes and mechanistic modeling, enabling us to generate a library of well-characterized synthetic transcription factors and corresponding promoters, which we then used to build gene-regulatory networks de novo. The well-characterized synthetic parts and insights gained should be useful for rationally engineering gene-regulatory networks and for studying the biophysics of transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {We study the influence of grafted polymers on the diffusive behaviour of a colloidal particle. Our work demonstrates how such additional degrees of freedom influence the Brownian motion of the particle, focusing on internal viscoelastic coupling between the polymer and colloid. Specifically, we study the mean-squared displacements (MSDs) of lambda-DNA grafted colloids using Brownian dynamics simulation. Our simulations reveal the non-trivial effect of internal modes, which gives rise to a crossover from the short-time viscoelastic to long-time diffusional behaviour. We also show that basic features can be captured by a simple theoretical model considering the relative motion of a colloid to a part of the polymer corona. This model describes well a MSD calculated from an extremely long trajectory of a single lambda-DNA coated colloid from experiment and allows characterisation of the lambda-DNA hairs. Our study suggests that the access to the internal relaxation modes via the colloid trajectory offers a novel method for the characterisation of soft attachments to a colloid.},
