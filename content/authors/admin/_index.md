My interests lie at the intersection of physics, biology and engineering. At EPFL I am carrying out research in cell-free synthetic biology, with the aim of enabling quantitative and predictive forward engineering in these simplified systems.

This work develops foundational technology for the growing field of cell-free synthetic biology. It also provides a unique approach to understanding life by building it up from its most basic components.

Outside the lab, I am a freelance classical pianist and vocal coach with interests in chamber music, opera, and accompaniment, and I give regular recitals in Switzerland and beyond.
